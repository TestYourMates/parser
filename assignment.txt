Write parser for log files. A sample of the log file is provided (resources/input.log).
The interesting fields are
    - timestamp
    - call name (i.e. reserve_money)
    - amount
    - email of billing address
    - storeid
    - ss_no, if exists, can be found under attachment 

A test, ParserTest.java, can be found in the project which verifies fields above in
the provided sample log file. To be completly finished with this assignment this test
should execute with all tests passed.

If the time is not enought, try to finish as much as possible on the parser.

Enjoy!
